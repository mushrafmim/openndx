# OE authentication

How the Orchestration Engine authenticates data consumers on `POST /public/graphql`. The other routes (`/health`, `/sdl*`) are not authenticated. The overview is in the [README](README.md).

The OE uses the shared [`internal/authn`](../../internal/authn) package, like Portal Backend. Every token's signature is verified; there is no setting that skips verification.

## What a consumer must present

An access token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, issued by the identity provider to a machine client for the OE's audience. In the bundled stack that is a ThunderID `client_credentials` token requested with `resource=http://api.openndx.local`; see the example in [dev/README.md](../../dev/README.md).

The token must:

| Check | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Signature | `RS256`, `RS384` or `RS512`, signed by a key in the JWKS at `IDP_JWKS_URL`, with a `kid` header that names the key. |
| `iss` | Equals `IDP_ISSUER`. |
| `aud` | Contains `IDP_AUDIENCE`. |
| `exp` | Present and in the future, with 30 seconds of leeway. `nbf`, when present, must not be in the future, with the same leeway. |
| `sub` | Present. |
| `client_id` | Present. It becomes the application's identity (`applicationId`) for the PDP and Consent Engine. |

A request without a valid token gets `401` with a JSON body, for example `{"error":"unauthorized","message":"invalid authentication token"}`. The reason is logged at debug level, not returned.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `IDP_JWKS_URL` | `$IDP_BASE_URL/oauth2/jwks` | Where the signing keys are fetched. Must be an `http` or `https` URL. |
| `IDP_ISSUER` | `IDP_TOKEN_URL`, else `$IDP_BASE_URL/oauth2/token` | The expected `iss`. Must be an `http` or `https` URL. |
| `IDP_AUDIENCE` | | **Required.** The expected `aud`, the OE's resource server identifier. |
| `IDP_JWKS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | `false` | `true` skips TLS certificate checks when fetching the JWKS. Local development only. |

The service exits at startup if `IDP_JWKS_URL`, `IDP_ISSUER` or `IDP_AUDIENCE` is missing or invalid. `IDP_ISSUER` must equal the `iss` the IdP stamps into tokens. ThunderID's is its public URL (`http://localhost:8090` locally), not `/oauth2/token`, so set `IDP_ISSUER` explicitly rather than relying on the `IDP_BASE_URL` default. In Docker Compose, `IDP_ISSUER` is ThunderID's public URL (the `iss` it stamps into tokens) and `IDP_JWKS_URL` its compose-network address.

## JWKS handling

The keys are fetched on the first request, not at startup, so the OE starts even when the IdP is not yet up. They are cached for 5 minutes. A token whose `kid` is not in the cached set triggers one refresh, so key rotation needs no restart.

## Production checklist

- Set `IDP_JWKS_URL` and `IDP_ISSUER` to the production IdP over `https`, and `IDP_AUDIENCE` to the OE's resource server.
- Leave `IDP_JWKS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` unset.
- Terminate TLS in front of the OE, and expose only `POST /public/graphql`.
